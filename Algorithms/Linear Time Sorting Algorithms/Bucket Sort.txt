Bucket sort is a linear time sorting algorithm .As the name implies and you have definitely guessed it .It uses buckets to sort the
input sequence.
Bucket sort is used in specific situations .Situations in which the input sequence is alredy known or the range of the sequence is known .
Such as {1,0,4,7,3,9,6  } This sequence which has all the numbers between 0 and 9 which means it is well dispersed .So can be implemented 
using an simple array  where you map every input value to a index and put there .
but what if we have  duplicates  that why we use bucket sort .Then every bucket can be sorted using insertion sort which also can achieve 
o(n) sorting time .

pseudo Code :

sort(arr[] , n)
1. let n be the length of input list L 
2.for each element  in L
2.1if b[i] is not empty 
put b[arr[i]]=arr[i]; using insertion sort
2.2else 
b[arr[i]]=arr[i];
3.concatenate b[1..n] into one sorted list
